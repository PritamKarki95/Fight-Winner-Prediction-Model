# Fight-Winner-Prediction-Model

# Overview:
Machine learning model to predict the winner between two entered fighters based on their statistics (weight, wins, losses, etc.) from a UFC fighters dataset, using Logistic Regression.

# Technologies Used:<br> 
-Python<br>
-pandas<br> 
-scikit-learn<br> 
-numpy<br>

# Dataset:<br>
-Weight<br>
-Wins<br>
-Losses<br>
-Fighter<br> 
-Reach in cm.<br>
-Significant strikes landed per_minute<br>
-Significant striking accuracy<br>
-Significant strikes absorbed per_minute<br>  
-Significant strike defence<br>
-Average takedowns landed per_15_minutes<br>
-Takedown accuracy<br>
-Takedown defense<br>
-Average submissions attempted per_15_minutes<br>

# To test the model with your own data, you can enter the fighter statistics directly through arrays as shown in the code.<br>
Enter your stats for Fighter A and Fighter B (dummy values, replace with yours)<br>
fighter_a = np.array([[10, 5, 180, 77, 183, 4.5, 65, 3.2, 80, 1.2, 40, 85, 0.3]])<br>
fighter_b = np.array([[8, 6, 178, 80, 185, 3.8, 60, 3.5, 78, 1.0, 38, 80, 0.4]])<br>
