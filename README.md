# Fight-Winner-Prediction-Model

#Overview:
Machine learning model to predict the winner between two entered fighters based on their statistics (weight, wins, losses, etc.) from a UFC fighters dataset, using Logistic Regression.

#Technologies Used: -Python  -pandas   -scikit-learn   -numpy

#Dataset:   -Weight   -Wins   -Losses   -Fighter Reach in cm.   -Significant strikes landed per_minute   -Significant striking accuracy   -Significant strikes absorbed per_minute   -Significant strike defence
   -Average takedowns landed per_15_minutes   -Takedown accuracy   -Takedown defense   -Average submissions attempted per_15_minutes

#To test the model with your own data, you can enter the fighter statistics directly through arrays as shown in the code.
Enter your stats for Fighter A and Fighter B (dummy values, replace with yours)
fighter_a = np.array([[10, 5, 180, 77, 183, 4.5, 65, 3.2, 80, 1.2, 40, 85, 0.3]]) 
fighter_b = np.array([[8, 6, 178, 80, 185, 3.8, 60, 3.5, 78, 1.0, 38, 80, 0.4]])
